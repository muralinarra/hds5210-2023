# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 54/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** (-1) Your code computed the correct probability and returned it. Your code should test for all invalid inputs.
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** (-1) Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests. Your code should return None if anything fails.
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** (-0.5) Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital. If the hospital name is not found, your code should return None rather than a blank string.
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** - Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** - Your code looped through all the results and compared them to the provided key

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
  * **(+7.5)** Your docstring is not formatted like Professor Boal's examples, and looks somewhat like ChatGPT output. Your code works as expected.

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
  * **Nice job.** 
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
  * **Your functions are well written and nicely formatted.** 
* Appropriate comments with your code?
  * **(-1) Include code comments to explain what your code is doing.** 
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **Your code is easy to follow and understand.**
