## Final Score: 7/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Complete

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **14.2 and 14.5 - Nice job on your code**
* **14.3 and 14.4 - (-3) LACE calculation - you did not write code as instructed in the assignment notebook; you wrote code that specifically passes the assert statements.
