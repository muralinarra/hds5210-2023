# Week 9 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

This assignment was focused on the use of Python and Pandas to load and visualize data, giving you something to interpret and help you understand the data. You did not nee to encapsulate your code in functions or provide docstrings/doctests in your functions.


## Final Score: 8/10

## First Half: Interpretation and Feedback
* 1pt - 41.1 **(-0.5)** You've made some correct statements about the data, but you have not identified a trend (what is happening over time).
* 1pt - 41.2 **(-0.5)** You've made some correct statements about the data, but you have not identified a trend (what is happening over time).
* 1pt - 41.3 - Okay.
* 1pt - 41.4 - Okay.

## Second Half: 41.5
* 2pt **(-0.5)** Where is this data from? Where would I go to find this data? Your first visualization is good.
* 1pt **(-0.5)** You could do more here with your observations for both visualizations.
* 2pt - Nice job on your second visualization
* 1pt - See comment above regarding observations.
