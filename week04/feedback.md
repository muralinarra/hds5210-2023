# Week 4 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 4/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Complete

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **Never, never alter the assert statements. If this happens again, you will receive a zero. Your code  for 20.3 and 20.4 does not pass the original assert statements. Again, do not change the assert statements on any assignments for the rest of this course.**
* **20.2 - You've initialized the same list twice.**
* **20.3 - your code does not produce a dictionary because your if statement is never true.**
* **20.4 - your code prints ‘diagnosis not found’ instead of ‘just right’.**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **Your variable names are good.**
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
  * **Your functions are nicely formatted.**
* Appropriate comments with your code?
  * **It's helpful to include code comments.**
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **Your code is easy to follow.**
